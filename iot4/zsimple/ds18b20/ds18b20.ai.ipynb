    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This project reads temperature data from two DS18B20 digital temperature sensors connected via the OneWire protocol on pin D2 of an ESP8266 D1 Mini board. The temperatures are displayed on the serial monitor every 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Setup\n",
    "- **Board**: ESP8266 D1 Mini\n",
    "- **Sensors**: 2x DS18B20 temperature sensors\n",
    "- **Connection**: Both sensors connected to pin D2 (GPIO4) via OneWire bus\n",
    "- **Pull-up Resistor**: A 4.7kΩ resistor is required between the data line and VCC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries Used\n",
    "- **OneWire**: Provides OneWire communication protocol\n",
    "- **DallasTemperature** (v4.0.6): High-level interface for DS18B20 sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization (`setup()`)\n",
    "1. **Serial Communication**: Starts at 115200 baud for debugging output\n",
    "2. **Device Discovery**: Scans the OneWire bus to find connected sensors\n",
    "3. **Address Assignment**: Retrieves unique 64-bit ROM addresses for each sensor\n",
    "4. **Resolution Setting**: Sets both sensors to 12-bit resolution (0.0625°C precision)\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Halts execution if fewer than 2 sensors are detected\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Loop (`loop()`)\n",
    "1. **Request Temperatures**: Sends command to all sensors to start temperature conversion\n",
    "2. **Read Values**: Retrieves temperature in Celsius from both sensors using their addresses\n",
    "3. **Display Results**: Prints both temperatures and their average to serial monitor\n",
    "4. **Delay**: Waits 2 seconds before next reading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Device Addressing**: Uses unique ROM addresses to identify specific sensors\n",
    "- **Multiple Sensors**: Reads from 2 sensors on the same data line using OneWire protocol\n",
    "- **Temperature Precision**: 12-bit resolution provides ±0.5°C accuracy\n",
    "- **Average Calculation**: Computes and displays average of both sensor readings\n",
    "- **Error Detection**: Validates that exactly 2 or more sensors are present at startup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serial Output Format\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sensor 1: 22.50°C  |  Sensor 2: 23.12°C  |  Average: 22.81°C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring\n",
    "Use PlatformIO's built-in serial monitor at 115200 baud to view the temperature readings, or run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pio device monitor -b 115200\n",
    "```\n"
